##The New York City Sanctuary Bond Fund

President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding to punish Sanctuary Cities. Sanctuary Bonds will allow New Yorkers to purchase a stake in the City of New York’s future, replacing every withheld dollar with a show of support for progressive immigration policies.

##What is a Sanctuary Bond?

A bond is money you loan to a local government, who holds the funds for a fixed period of time at a fixed interest rate. Bonds have been used in periods of war and economic depression as a way for wealthy and privileged people to make a low-risk investment in the long-term prosperity of their community by providing the funds needed for short-term projects.

Sanctuary Bonds will be financed by New Yorkers who know that our strength and ingenuity are intertwined with our diversity. These bonds will raise reserve funds in case of federal withholdings.

##Great idea! How can I help?

Call Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office at (212) 788-1400. Here’s what you should say:

I am New Yorker and I want the City of New York to be financially sound in protecting our immigrant citizens. Please create Sanctuary Bonds that allow New Yorkers like me to invest in the future of our diverse city of immigrants.
After you’ve called Mayor de Blasio, you can also call City Comptroller Scott Stringer at (212) 669-3916, Public Advocate Letitia James at (212) 669-7250 and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito at 347-297-4922.

##Tell me some inspirational history?

In 1975, New York City was bankrupt. After President Gerald Ford refused to bail out the city, bonds provided New Yorkers with a lifeline out of financial ruin. Bonds helped build the Brooklyn Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Second Avenue Subway and much more of New York.

This simple idea of New Yorkers investing in the city’s future even stands underfoot of the Statue of Liberty. The funds the purchase the Lady Liberty’s pedestal were raised instead by some 120,000 donors, many of them immigrants, many contributing less than $1 each.

We are proud of those immigrants. They are our grand-parents, our parents, our neighbors, ourselves. Now we raise the funds needed to defend our city, so it may always remain a sanctuary.
