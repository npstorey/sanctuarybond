## Sanctuary Bond Fund

New York City is a city of immigrants.  
New York City is a sanctuary city.  
Here, we stand up for each other.  
Here, we put our money where our mouth is.

**DONATE TO THE SANCTUARY BOND FUND**

President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from cities and states that protect their immigrant citizens. The Sanctuary Bond Fund intends to replace every immorally withheld dollar with money pledged by New Yorkers.

1. We raise money as a reserve fund to replace federal funds threatened to be withheld to sanctuary cities, counties, or states, starting with New York City.

2. We encourage local governments to create Sanctuary Bonds to finance the independence of our sanctuary cities, towns, and villages.

You can show your support for Sanctuary Bonds by making a donation to our first campaign: Sanctuary Bond NYC. Every dollar will be given to **[organization]** until such time that sanctuary bonds are made official, and you’ll get a replica Sanctuary Bond in the mail. We’ll also send a replica Sanctuary Bond to your local elected representatives to build support for official Sanctuary Bonds.

**DONATE NOW**


## What is a Sanctuary Bond?

A bond is money you loan to a local government like the City of New York, who holds the funds for a fixed period of time at a fixed interest rate. Bonds have been used in periods of [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond) and [economic depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Assistance_Corporation) as a way for wealthy and privileged people to make a low-risk investment in the long-term prosperity of their community by providing the funds needed for short-term projects.

Sanctuary Bonds will be financed by New Yorkers who know that our strength and ingenuity are intertwined with our diversity. These bonds will raise reserve funds in case of federal withholdings.

## How would that work?

Sanctuary Bonds don’t exist yet, but this is one way that they could work.

As a New Yorker, you can buy one or many bonds. The bonds are based on the [social impact bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_bond) model that only pay investors back if we achieve a desired social outcome. For Sanctuary Bonds, investors (mutual funds, unions, government pension systems) only get their money back if federal funding remains intact to sanctuary jurisdictions.

Repayment of the bond plus interest occurs if the Sanctuary Bond funds are not used in five years (due to successful political or legal challenges), or if withheld federal funds are returned by a subsequent administration in five years.

If the federal government does follow through with its threat to withhold tax money from a sanctuary city with a Sanctuary Bond, the money is used to fill in the budget hole.

Repayment of the bond does not occur if the Sanctuary Bond funds are used to replace withheld federal funds, and not later restored by a subsequent administration.

Until official Sanctuary Bonds exist, we are pledging to raise the first $1 million through small, crowd-sourced donations.  Donate to the Sanctuary Bond Fund.  


## Tell me some inspirational history?

In 1975, after President Gerald Ford rejected pleas for a bailout from a bankrupt New York City, bonds issued through the Municipal Assistance Corporation in New York provided a lifeline for the city out of financial ruin. Bonds built the Brooklyn Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Second Avenue Subway and much more of New York.

This simple idea of New Yorkers investing in the city’s future even stands underfoot of the Statue of Liberty. When the French government offered to commemorate the end of slavery and the Union victory in the Civil War with a statue of Lady Liberty, our war-ravaged government had no funds to build the pedestal needed to the statue to stand on. The funds were raised instead by some 120,000 donors, many of them immigrants, many contributing less than $1 each.

We are proud of those immigrants. They are our grand-parents, our parents, our neighbors, ourselves. Now we raise the funds needed to defend the sanctuaries that defend the immigrants. Donate to the Sanctuary Bond Fund.  


## I donated to the Sanctuary Bond Fund. What else can I do?

It is in the power of the mayor and the city comptroller to create city-issued bonds. Give City Comptroller Scott Stringer a call at **TKTK**. Then call Mayor Bill de Blasio at **TKTK**. Tell them you want to City of New York to create sanctuary bonds that will allow us independence from the federal government while we protect our immigrant citizens.  

Here’s a script:
I am New Yorker and I want the City of New York to be financially confident in protecting our immigrant citizens. Please create Sanctuary Bonds that allow me as a New Yorker to invest in the future of our diverse city of immigrants.
